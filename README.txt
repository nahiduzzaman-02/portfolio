# Portfolio — Pure HTML/CSS/JS

This is a clean, multi‑page personal portfolio you can customize and host for free.

## Pages
- Home (`index.html`)
- Activity (`activity.html`)
- Passion (`passion.html`)
- Achievement (`achievement.html`)
- Contact (`contact.html`)

## How to customize
- Replace text like "Your Name" and placeholder content on each page.
- Put your real photo at `assets/img/profile-placeholder.png` (use the same file name).
- Edit colors and spacing in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add more pages by duplicating one of the HTML files and updating nav links.

## How to host (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload the entire folder contents.
3. Go to Settings → Pages → set the branch to `main` and folder to `/root` (or `/docs` if you prefer).
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Alternatively, drop the folder on Netlify or Vercel.
